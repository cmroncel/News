# News
The latest news project with Master-Detail app.



A study application with customized tableviews where current news is published.

News are listed on the first page. The photograph and title of the news in each cell were taken with the request of GET and printed on the screen.
The visualization of the cells found here is customized.


When any news is touched, the detail page of that news opens. On this page, if there is a video of the news, there is a photo of the news and the explanations of the news.
Customized tableview is also used on this page. The video player becomes full screen when it switches to landscape mode, and when it portrait mode returns to original state.
